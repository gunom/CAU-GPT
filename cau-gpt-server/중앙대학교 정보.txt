Location of 중앙 University


The number of departments at 중앙 University is 64 as of 2023.

중앙 University was founded on October 17, 1916, at the Central Methodist Church in Jongno-gu, Seoul, with the purpose of training kindergarten teachers. It was promoted to the Central Nursery School in 1922, and in 1933, 임영신 took over the Central Nursery School and opened the Kyungsung Central Kindergarten at the Central Nursery School in 1941. In February 1953, the university was reorganized as a comprehensive university and established four colleges and graduate schools: College of Letters, College of Law, College of Commerce, and College of Pharmacy. In 1991, the name of the corporation was changed from 중앙 Cultural Institute to 중앙 University. In 2008, 김희수, the chairman of the board of directors, stepped down as chairman of the board of directors and Doosan Group became involved in the management of the corporation, and 박용성 was appointed as chairman of the board of directors. In March 2009, the Graduate School of Law and Graduate School of Medicine opened. The Seoul Campus and Anseong Campus are operating as a single campus after receiving a consolidation license from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The Pyeongdong Campus in Pyeongdong (Gyeonggyojang-gil) and the Performing and Visual Arts Center in Dongseong-dong (Daehak-ro) are used by 중앙 University's College of Arts.

It is commonly referred to as 중앙 University.

Locations
Seoul Campus

The Seoul campus is located in Geokseok-dong, where the first president, Dr. 임영신, purchased the land. As of 2022, the campus covers an area of 182,960.4 m2 and includes 25 buildings. Seoul Campus is home to the College of Liberal Arts, College of Education, College of Social Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Creative ICT, College of Software, College of Business and Economics, College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, College of Red Cross and Red Crescent Nursing, and some majors (theater, film, and spatial performance) of the College of Performing Arts. There are also kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools, and 중앙 University Hospital located near the campus.

Anseong Campus

Anseong Campus was established in 1980 as a branch school with a partially dualized campus character after the College of Arts (formerly Seorabal College of Arts) and College of Agriculture (now College of Biotechnology) were relocated from the Seoul Campus. Anseong Campus covers an area of 962,669 square meters and has more than 40 buildings and other locations. In 2011, it received approval from the Ministry of Education to merge its branches and become a single school, and has been recruiting students as a dual campus since 2012. As of 2021, the Anseong campus is home to the College of Biotechnology, College of Arts, College of Arts and Engineering, College of Physical Education, and the College of Engineering's Department of Advanced Materials. It is located in Daedeok-myeon, Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do.

History
Japanese Occupation

The origin of 중앙 University is the 중앙 Kindergarten, which was established on October 17, 1916, by the Methodist Church for missionary purposes. Later, as the kindergarten education movement, "Gain independence by cultivating skills through educational activities," became active, several kindergartens were created in the 1920s. In order to train kindergarten teachers, a teacher's department was established at the Central Kindergarten, and it began to play a role as a specialized educational institution by training teachers. In 1922, the teacher's department of the Central Kindergarten was promoted to the Central Nursery School, which was not a vocational school according to the law, but was considered a vocational school according to social convention. Due to Japanese repression, the operation of the Central Nursery School was moved to a private house in 1932, and the number of students was reduced to 10. In 1933, 임영신 took over the school and became its principal. After returning to Korea from the United States in 1932, 임영신 believed that the way to save the Korean people was through education, so he bought a school site in Geokseok-dong and took over as principal.

Although the school was located in Kwakseok-dong, he did not have a schoolhouse, so he rented the Pierson Bible School and began teaching. However, due to financial limitations and Japanese repression, the school's operation continued to be difficult. 임영신, who went to the United States to develop the school, established the Pierson Foundation to support the Central Nursery School through fundraising activities and returned home. In May 1938, the school was relocated to a new building in Kwakseok-dong.

At this time, Japan started the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, starting the Pacific War. In addition, the government closed the Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo in 1940 and promulgated the Wartime Emergency Measures for Education in 1943. The 중앙 Nursery School was especially repressed because its principal, 임영신, had studied in the United States and was a Christian. By the end of World War II, the school was unable to recruit new students and was forced to close in 1944 due to Japanese repression.

Liberation and the Korean War

On August 15, 1945, Korea was liberated, and on September 28, 1945, 임영신 opened the doors of the Central Nursery School and instituted the lesson and school song "Die to Righteousness and Live to Truth". On October 1 of the same year, the Central Nursery School was reorganized into the Central Women's College in order to nurture talented people who would build the new nation and provide them with spiritual direction. In November 1946, the Central Cultural Institute was established as a foundation, laying the foundation for the school's development. A year later, in April 1947, the school was reorganized as 중앙 Women's College, and again in May 1948, the school changed its name to 중앙 University, a coeducational institution.

Then, in May 1950, the first bachelor's degree conferral ceremony was held, but the school was closed due to the Korean War, and after the restoration of Seoul on September 28, the school re-enrolled students, moved all the school's documents to Busan, and set up a temporary office of 중앙 University there. Then, in April 1951, 중앙 University opened its own classes instead of the wartime Allied University in Songdo, Busan, and subsequently set up branches in Erie and Seoul to start classes. Through these efforts, two to four professional bachelor's degree ceremonies were held in Busan from 1951 to 1953.

Promotion and Development as a University

In February 1953, 중앙 University was promoted to a comprehensive university. Nine departments and graduate schools were established in four colleges, including the College of Letters, the College of Law, the College of Gyeongsang, and the College of Pharmacy, and 임영신 was appointed president. Afterward, due to the armistice, the school was moved from Busan to Geokseok-dong in August, but because the U.S. Eighth Army was stationed there, lectures were held at Gagyo-sa. In April 1954, the school was taken over by the U.S. military.

Then, from 1955 to 1959, the university grew to 2,850 students in 19 departments in four colleges by expanding the number of departments. In response to this expansion and the increasing number of students, Pfeiffer Hall was built in 1956, and the Central Library was built and opened in 1959. At the same time, the International Cultural Research Institute was established to strengthen research activities, and the curriculum was continuously supplemented and revised to systematize education, and the education business was expanded to provide systematic education with sister schools such as Nakyang Middle and Industrial High School, Youngshin Girls' Middle School, Youngshin Middle School, and an affiliated kindergarten.

In 1960, the April 19 Revolution took place in protest of the March 15 fraudulent election, and students from 중앙 University participated in it, and in 1961, as the country went through various twists and turns, including the May 16 military coup, the second president, 임성희, was inaugurated in 1961, but in May 1963, Dr. 임영신 was inaugurated as the third president.

In January 1965, the College of Arts and Letters was separated and reorganized into the College of Letters, College of Science, and College of Education, and the College of Law, College of Gyeongsangnam-do, and College of Pharmacy were combined to form six colleges. In addition, the sister middle and high schools were renamed the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Education and the College of Pharmacy were established to provide consistent education from kindergarten to graduate school under the same foundation. In February 1967, the Graduate School of Social Development was established; in 1968, the university was expanded and reorganized into eight colleges, including the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Education, College of Law, College of Canon Law, College of Business Administration, College of Agriculture, and College of Pharmacy; and in December 1971, the medical school was established and the Sacred Heart Hospital in Pil-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul was absorbed as a university hospital.

This expansion of the university organization was accompanied by the creation of new facilities. In July 1961, the Jinseon Hall and the University Theater were completed, and in October of the same year, the Social Science Building was completed. In 1968, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the school's opening, the Cheongryong statue was built to safely store and transmit documents and handwriting from the time until 100 years later. At this time, Seungdang Hall was also built, and the following year, in December 1969, Bost Hall was completed, contributing to the internalization of education.

By the 1970s, 임영신 was approaching the age of 70 and was no longer physically able to carry out the duties of president. In 1972, 임철순 took over as the fourth president. At this time, international exchanges were becoming more frequent and society was diversifying, so it was of utmost importance to develop the university to meet the needs of the times. Therefore, the development of applied disciplines could not be expected without the development of basic disciplines, so the College of Engineering was established by separating the College of Science and Technology, and the College of Letters and Science was established by combining the basic fields of natural science in the College of Letters and Science. For the arts, in June 1972, the Seorabal Arts College, which was operated by the existing school corporation, Seorabal Arts Institute, was merged, and in 1974, it was reorganized into the College of Arts. A second college was added in 1978, and the Graduate School of International Business and the Graduate School of Education were established in January 1979. Along with the expansion of the university structure, facilities were also expanded. In October 1972, the Jinsun Hall was expanded to form the Seorabal Hall, and in 1974, the Natural Hall, a teacher's building in the College of Medicine, was completed. In December 1976, the Student Union Building was completed, and in June 1978, the new building of the Sacred Heart Hospital affiliated with the College of Medicine in Pil-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, was completed. In February 1977, Dr. 임영신, the founder of 중앙 University and a man who made many developments, passed away.

Establishment of Anseong Campus

In May 1980, Dr. 이석희, a professor of philosophy at the College of Liberal Arts, was inaugurated as the fifth president, succeeding President 임철순. In November of the same year, the Graduate School of Journalism and Broadcasting was established, and in December, an annex to the Medical School Hospital was completed.

While the school continued to expand its facilities in the Seoul area, it also worked to expand its educational organization in Anseong. In March 1980, construction of the second campus began, moving the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Agriculture (now the College of Biotechnology) from the Seoul campus to the Anseong campus, and completing the first teacher's building, the second dormitory, and the first student union. In October 1981, three new colleges were added to Anseong Campus: College of Foreign Languages, College of Social Sciences, and College of Home Economics. From March 1982, the school in Seoul was named the first campus and the school in Anseong the second campus. In October 1982, the music department in the College of Arts was expanded and developed into the College of Music, and in September 1983, the College of Agriculture was renamed the College of Industry, with a graduate school of construction. In October 1984, the College of Construction was established on the second campus in Anseong, bringing the number of colleges on the second campus to seven. Then, in 1998, the College of Physical Education was added, and in 2001, Korea's first College of Gugak and Graduate School of Gugak Education were added.

With the reorganization of the second campus and the addition of colleges, educational facilities were expanded one after another. In December 1980, the second teacher building was completed in Anseong Gosa, and in 1981, a large sports field and the second student center were completed. In 1982, the Faculty Research Building, the Experiment Building of the College of Agriculture, and the College of Arts were completed. In 1983, the College of Music completed its lecture and auditorium buildings, outdoor swimming pool, and gymnasium. In 1984, an extension to the College of Music and a third teaching building were completed, followed by the Central Library in 1989 and the Soorim Gymnasium in 1999, marking the beginning of a modern campus.

The many facility investments in the second campus strained the school's finances, adding to the foundation's debt, and the poor management of businesses under the school corporation caused overall problems in university operations. In March 1985, Dr. 문병집 was inaugurated as the sixth president. In order to rationalize the university's operations, he initiated the reorganization of the operating system. He reorganized the planning, budgeting, and financial administration system and revised various regulations on university operations to institutionalize and rationalize the administrative system, introduced the system of vice presidents for academic affairs and vice presidents for administrative affairs, established an employment guidance department, and reorganized the operating systems of the Central Cultural Research Institute and the Medical Center. In addition, the university reinstated the French and Japanese literature departments of the College of Letters, established the Department of Industrial Information, and promoted the construction of a modern central library on the second campus. However, the accumulated debt of the school foundation made it difficult for the foundation to exist and brought many difficulties to the university's operation.

After 김희수 took over

The financial difficulties of the corporation that runs the university have not been overcome, and by 1987, it was reported that the debt of the school corporation and the corporations under the school corporation amounted to 70 billion won. The financial difficulties of the corporation became a fact, and the corporation lost the ability to overcome this financial crisis, and the members of the university, students, faculty, and alumni, were unable to propose the old school's solution of debt settlement. The university tried to negotiate with prominent Korean businessmen to take over the management of the school corporation, but no one stepped forward due to the enormous amount of debt and the backlash it could cause within the business community.

At this time, Dr. 김희수, a Korean-American businessman, decided to take charge of the school corporation, formed a new board of directors, and became the chairman of the board. He was born in Changwon, Gyeongnam, and went to Japan in 1937 at the age of 13, graduated from Tokyo Electric University, and established and operated one of Japan's leading companies, KUMJUNG. He studied under the ethnic discrimination of the Japanese government, and experienced many ethnic tragedies while establishing and developing his company. At the same time, while thinking about the future of the nation, he was burning with patriotism and came to the conclusion that the eternal independence of the nation could only be achieved by the human resources cultivated through education, so he took charge of the higher education business in his home country in earnest, although he was also operating educational institutions in Japan.

This was a first for a Korean-American entrepreneur, and while there have been successful cases of Korean-Americans starting businesses in Japan, this was the first time they were involved in education.

At the same time, in 1989, the College of Letters and Science was separated into the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Advertising and Public Relations was established by separating the advertising and public relations fields from the Department of Newspaper and Broadcasting. In addition, the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Biological Engineering were established at the second campus, and the expansion of the school by establishing the Graduate School of Public Administration and the Graduate School of Industrial Technology and Management began to move forward.

In February 1989, for the first time in the university's history, Dr. 하경근 was inaugurated as the eighth president of the university after the faculty and staff voted for him. At this time, a five-day work week was introduced to improve the working conditions of employees, and new students were recruited in two periods. Meanwhile, the administration, student affairs, and general affairs offices were located at the second campus for the balanced development of the first and second campuses, and the language school and the international cooperation department were merged to form the international education department.

In February 1991, the name of the school corporation was changed from "중앙 University" to "중앙 University," and a computer center with a supercomputer was built on the first campus, a lecture hall for the law and business schools was built, and a graduate school building was built. On the second campus, a dormitory, a construction school, an industrial school, and faculty housing were built to improve educational conditions.

However, in October 1991, despite the establishment of the Graduate School of Information Industry as part of the Ministry of Education's expansion and increase, there was a great deal of unrest on campus as a result of the assessment that "the educational conditions of the College of Engineering were inferior to those of other universities." In response, in March 1992, a specialized committee for the establishment of a university development plan was formed centered on professors in each field, and a full-scale short- and long-term university development plan was initiated. In April, representatives of various groups on campus gathered to form the "Joint Council for University Development," and with the participation of the presidents of the corporation and the Alumni Association, they sought concrete measures to restore stability and order to the university.

Meanwhile, the corporation, through its board of directors, appointed Dr. 김민하 as acting president in June 1992 to serve the remainder of President 하경근's term. Immediately upon taking office, Dr. 김민하 issued an "Appeal to the Central Family," calling for the restoration of mutual trust among the entire central family to lay the foundation for the stability and development of the university, and proposed concrete action plans, and together with the Joint Council for University Development, resolved the problems one by one. In addition, the expansion of educational facilities continued, and the College of Arts and Sciences was expanded, the Pil-dong Hospital attached to the College of Medicine was expanded, and a new building for the College of Science was constructed.

In February 1993, Dr. 金玟河 was inaugurated as the ninth president of the university after the "Presidential Candidate Policy Presentation Meeting" and the election process of presidential candidates by faculty, staff, and students to gather opinions on how to select presidential candidates.

In addition to demonstrating his ability to smoothly overcome the campus unrest, which had been referred to as the biggest crisis since the university's inception, President 金玟河 drew on the wisdom and capabilities of the central family, accumulated over the years, to propose four indicators for the development of a future-oriented university: "ethnic university," "democratic university," "advanced university," and "creation of a healthy and new university culture," and declared their implementation. In November 1994, the Graduate School of Medicine and Food Management was established to meet the growing demand for professionals in the fields of medicine and food, and in March 1995, the College of Science and Forestry Building was completed, and in April, the First Campus Women's Dormitory, with a capacity of 150 students on six floors, was completed. In August, the current Bost Hall was expanded to secure the external competitiveness of the Engineering Department, and in December, the Computer Center was expanded.

In March 1998, the College of Physical Education and Sports Sciences was established on the second campus, aimed at social and physical education; the College of Home Economics was renamed the College of Life Sciences and the College of Industry was renamed the College of Industrial Sciences in October; and in November 1999, the Graduate School of Advanced Imaging was established in accordance with the government's "Brain Korea 21" plan, contributing to the specialization of the field, and was selected as the best university for five consecutive years in the "Financial Support Project for Excellent Universities for Education Reform" implemented by the Ministry of Education. In addition, to improve the university's education and research environment, the university relocated and opened an affiliated high school and an affiliated kindergarten, opened the Information and Communication Culture Center in the main building, built and renovated the University Hall and wastewater treatment plant on the second campus, and opened the Central Culture and Arts Center, and published the history "80 Years of 중앙 University."

Meanwhile, the delayed implementation of the promise to build a 1,000-bed medical school hospital (MEDICAL CENTER) at the inauguration of President 김희수 led to a protest by medical students, trainees, and specialists. Fortunately, the relocation and opening of the affiliated high school to Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu, along with the protests urging the construction of the new hospital, led to a situation in which students refused to attend classes and went on strike, leading to a pay crisis, which was resolved in October 1997 when the corporation and the university jointly promised to build the hospital at this location and the medical students accepted this promise.

The 2000s and beyond

At the beginning of the new millennium, Prof. 박명수 was inaugurated as the 11th president in February 2001. Upon his inauguration, he presented "new vision," "new culture," and "new behavior" as the guiding principles for "creating a new center through change and development," and established "DRAGON2018," a university development plan with a different concept from the past.

In addition, the College of Gugak was established in February 2000, the Graduate School of Gugak Education in December 2002, and the Graduate School of Entrepreneurship and Management in September 2004, and the 'Leading Specialization' project was promoted as the core project to cultivate 'central people' for 'Dragon 2018' and the 'Strategic Specialization' project as the core project to cultivate 'central teams', In addition, as a core project to create a 'central place', we built a medical campus of 18,000 square meters on the first campus, a faculty research building and gymnasium of 6,000 square meters, a complex building of 10,000 square meters (redevelopment of the university theater), a college of gugak of 3,000 square meters on the second campus, a dormitory of 2,000 square meters, and a player's dormitory and studio room of 700 square meters.

In February 2005, Dr. 박범훈 was inaugurated as the 12th president. In order to build a new center of "creation and harmony," he presented seven pledges to develop into a "world-class university with knowledge creation and learning capabilities," and oversaw the successful attraction of four national projects, including the evaluation of Daekyo Association, the characterization of the metropolitan area, BK21, and the attraction of a law school, which were his first election tasks. He was selected as a leading university for structural reform by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, which was the biggest issue at the time, and received financial support (9.1 billion won) equal to other universities despite a one-year grace period.

In the four years since President 박범훈 took office, the university has invested heavily in improving the educational environment, including educational and research equipment, and in February 2007, the largest law building in Korea was completed, and a master plan was prepared to build a pharmacy and natural science R&D center around the main entrance of Campus 1 and an engineering R&D center around the large sports field. In November 2007, the university signed a memorandum of understanding with Hanam City to promote the 'Hanam Campus'. It was later decided to abandon the Hanam Campus and build the Gumdan Campus in Gumdan New Town.

In addition, the university invited 244 full-time faculty members from 2005 to 2007, and opened the Graduate School of Law and Graduate School of Medicine in March 2009. In the same year, he introduced relative evaluation to all subjects and added "Accounting and Society" to the required liberal arts courses so that all students can learn accounting.

In the four years since President 박범훈 took office, the university has raised a total of 40 billion won in development funds, 166.3 billion won in external research grants, and 17.3 billion won in government financial support projects, totaling 216 billion won. In addition, we introduced a performance-based annual salary system for the first time in Korea and improved the promotion and reappointment system to strengthen the criteria for professors' promotions and raises.

In May 2008, Doosan Group joined the school's management, and 박용성 was inaugurated as the ninth chairman of the board. On August 27, 2008, 80 days after his inauguration, he announced the CAU2018+ mid- and long-term development plan at the All-Faculty Meeting, presenting a new strategic direction of "selecting and focusing, strengthening execution, and establishing a virtuous cycle." To achieve the university's development vision through internal changes, the university introduced the first 100% salary system in Korea. The wage system for faculty and staff was also converted from a fixed salary system to an annual salary system, and the administrative organization was reorganized. By strengthening the academic management system, students are required to complete a certain level of English proficiency and newly required subjects such as accounting to graduate. New R&D centers were built, new dormitories were constructed, the central library was remodeled, and a 300-bed hospital was expanded.

Suspicions that former President Park Bum-hoon gave preferential treatment to 중앙 University after becoming Cheong Wa Dae's chief of education and culture emerged in 2015, and Doosan Group Chairman 박용성 and other officials were investigated for allegedly bribing the Blue House. In the meantime, 중앙 University abandoned the Gumdan Campus project, which had been its main focus.

Libraries
204 Central Library

The Central Library began construction of a new library on October 25, 1958, at its current location and was completed about a year later on October 23, 1959. Because the library was built with foreign funding and the cooperation of former President Syngman Rhee, the library was initially named Unam Memorial Library, after Syngman Rhee's family name. After the 4.19 Revolution, the Unam Memorial Library was renamed to the current National Library of Korea. In August 2009, it was remodeled and expanded to 14,258.2 m2 (4,320 pyeong) and equipped with 3,400 reading seats and various user facilities. The library currently has more than 1 million books and various non-book materials, 2,500 serials, 80,000 titles of e-journals, 120 Web DBs, 27,000 full-text DBs of the university's theses, and 40,000 e-books.

In 1972, when the university acquired Surabal College of Art and Design, it was renamed Surabal Hall. The current appearance of Seorabal Hall is an extension of the original building, which was attached to the building facing Liberation Square.

Then in 1968, on the 50th anniversary of the school's opening, a bust of Mrs. Pfeiffer was placed at the entrance of the building and it became known as Pfeiffer Hall.
